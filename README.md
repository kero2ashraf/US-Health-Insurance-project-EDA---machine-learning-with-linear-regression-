# US-Health-Insurance-project-EDA---machine-learning-with-linear-regression-

In this project , i am talking about US health insurance that contain columns about age , smoker , have children or not , from where , etc.

python packages : 

1) numpy 
2) pandas
3) matplotlib.pyplot 
4) seaborn 
5 ) from sklearn import linear_model
6) sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
7 ) sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

my questions :

1) Give on overview about the data ( cleaning and statistical summary)?
2) Make analysis on age column?
3) make a plot between count and age ?
4) make a kdeplot between density and age ?
5) make a boxplot about age?
6) Make analysis on sex analysis and make a countplot on it?
7) Make a BMI analysis and make visualization like (kdeplot , histogram , boxplot ) ?
8) Make a children  analysis and make visualization like (countplot) ?
9) Make a Region analysis and make a countplot between the region and the count?
10) Make a charges Analysis and make a visualization like (displot,boxplot)
11) Make a bivariate analysis on each column with charges?
12) Make a multivariate analysis ?
13) make a data preprocessing and use machine learning ?
14) train the model and test it using train test split?
15) make the first regression model about categorical feartures including buckets created from numeric features ?
16) get the first model accuracy of the train and the test ?
17) make the second regression model about the numeric age and bmi varibles?
18) Get the cofficients and the intercept of the two models ?
19) get the second model accuracy of the train and the test ?
